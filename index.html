                    <strong> What is the coronavirus? </strong> <br>
                    Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that affect mammals and birds. They can cause respiratory
                    infections in humans, with severities ranging from mild to lethal.
                    <br> <br>

                    <strong> What are some examples of coronaviruses? </strong> <br>
                    Notable examples of members of this family include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> The common cold. Mild symptoms. </li>
                    <li> Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). Outbreak in 2003. Potentially lethal. </li>
                    <li> Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). Outbreak in 2012. Potentially lethal. </li>
                    <li> Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Ongoing outbreak. Potentially lethal. </li>

                    <strong> What is the Novel Coronavirus? </strong> <br>
                    The Novel Coronavirus, or more commonly referred to in the media simply as "coronavirus", is a
                    coronavirus originating in the capital of Hubei in China, Wuhan. It was discovered when a multitude
                    of citizens started to display symptoms of a disease like pneumonia; however, doctors were unable to
                    treat it, nor were they able to identify the cause. It is hypothesized to be a zoonotic disease,
                    having originated from victims consuming animals such as bats.

                    Transmissions have been confirmed to occur between humans via breathing, coughing, or sneezing.
                    Those who have visited Mainland China recently may be at risk. Elderly people and people with
                    pre-existing medical conditions are more susceptible to 2019-nCoV.
                    <br> <br>

                    <strong> What are some symptoms? </strong> <br>
                    Symptoms will typically start to appear anytime from two days to two weeks after contracting the
                    virus. Some signs of the virus include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Fever </li>
                    <li> Cough </li>
                    <li> Shortness of Breath </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    Individuals are advised to wear proper face masks to prevent the spread of the disease. If you
                    suspect that you may have the virus, contact a medical professional through the telephone,
                    <strong> not </strong> in person.
